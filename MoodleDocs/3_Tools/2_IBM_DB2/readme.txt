Any useful SQL editor as well as MS Access need access to the university IBM DB2 database.

You can install the IBM DB2 client onto your computer to have access.

The client needs to be configured for the university IBM DB2 database with the script
catalog.sql.

You may find a standalone IBM DB2 client on IBMs web page. Alternatively, you can install
IBMs DB2 Express-C DBMS: http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/de/db2expressc
